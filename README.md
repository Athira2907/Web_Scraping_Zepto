##Web Scraping Zepto
* For the dynamic webpage of Zepto, I used selenium to scape data.
* I scraped different categories from the "ul" tag using webdriver.
* Then from every link, the page was redirected to page of respective category and after storing required data in lists, homepage was loaded to move to next category.
* Using pandas, the lists were converted to a DataFrame and then into excel document.
